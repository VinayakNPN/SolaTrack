<p align="center">
  <strong>Revolutionizing supply chain transparency with Solana blockchain and IoT integration</strong>
</p>

## 🌟 About SolaTrack

SolaTrack is a decentralized supply chain tracking solution built on the Solana blockchain. It provides end-to-end visibility and traceability for products moving through complex supply chains. By combining the immutability and transparency of blockchain with IoT sensor data, SolaTrack ensures product authenticity, compliance, and real-time monitoring.

## ✨ Features

- **Immutable Tracking**: Every product movement and condition change is recorded permanently on Solana blockchain
- **IoT Integration**: Real-time sensor data (temperature, humidity, location) automatically updates product status
- **Smart Contract Automation**: Compliance rules and alerts are encoded in Solana programs
- **Multi-Stakeholder Access**: Manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and consumers all gain appropriate visibility
- **High Performance**: Leveraging Solana's high throughput (65,000+ TPS) and sub-second finality
- **Low Transaction Costs**: Fraction of a cent per transaction compared to other blockchain solutions

## 🏛 Architecture

SolaTrack consists of three main components:

1. **Solana Programs (Smart Contracts)**: Handles product registration, tracking updates, and access control
2. **IoT Integration Layer**: Secure connection between IoT sensors and the blockchain
3. **User Interfaces**: Web and mobile applications for different stakeholders

## 💼 Use Cases
